# Image Quality Assesment Using Reinforcment Learning

The quality of medical images can strongly influence the clinicianâ€™s to perceive the appropriate diagnostic features. However, the definition of quality may differ considering the task performed on each image. To deal with this issue, we have implemented two image quality assessment (IQA) techniques in this project. In the first algorithm, we train an agent using reinforcement learning to determine the image quality based on how amenable it is for a defined task without having quality labels that are manually defined by humans. In this method, the training set is used to optimize the defined task predictor network. At the same time, the agent tries to maximize its accumulated reward by achieving a higher performance on the controller-selected validation set. In the second algorithm, we use meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) to increase the adaptability of both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on high-quality, expert-labeled training data. We have used PPO and DDPG algorithms for training the controller network.
The results of the first technique show that removing poor-quality images can achieve 85.71% and 90.82$ classification accuracies for PneumoniaMNIST and Echocar- diography datasets, respectively, which are higher than the baseline accuracy. More- over, the utilized adaptation strategy in the IQA algorithm allows for the IQA agent and task predictor to be adapted using as few as 30% of expert labeled Echocar- diography data, which drastically reduces the need for expensive expert labeled data.
